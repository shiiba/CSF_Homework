            While our simpleNumberOfCoinsRequired works for most
            sane currency denominations, it does not work for all currencies.
            Consider a currency with the denominations 1, 5, 7 and 20.
            Our previous algorithm would say that 3 coins were needed to make
            change for 10, when in fact 2 is the actual solution (2 coins of value 5).

            We must take a different approach to solve for this. Instead of a 'greedy'
            algorithm, we will use memoization.

            Our algorithm must do the following:
                * For each possible value, from 1 to totalSum
                 * If that value is a coin denomination, it's required count is 1
                 * If not, examine that value minus all possible denominations
                    * e.g. If the value was 8, you would look at the number of coins
                      required for 8 - 7, 8 - 5 and 8 - 1.
                 * Take the smallest of those values, plus one
                 * Repeat
                * Return the calculated value for totalSum

            A sample solution:
